## <a name="config_input_variables"></a>Config Module Input Variables
Input variables used in the config module are all defined in config/variables.tf:

### <a name="tf_variables"></a>Terraform Provider Variables
Variable Name | Description | Required | Default Value
--------------|-------------|----------|--------------
**tenancy_ocid** | The OCI tenancy id where this configuration will be executed. This information can be obtained in OCI Console. | Yes | None
**user_ocid** | The OCI user id that will execute this configuration. This information can be obtained in OCI Console. The user must have the necessary privileges to provision the resources. | Yes | ""
**fingerprint** | The user's public key fingerprint. This information can be obtained in OCI Console. | Yes | ""
**private_key_path** | The local path to the user private key. | Yes | ""
**private_key_password** | The private key password, if any. | No | ""

### <a name="env_variables"></a>Environment Variables
Variable Name | Description | Required | Default Value
--------------|-------------|----------|--------------
**region** \* | The tenancy region identifier where the Terraform should provision the resources. | Yes | None
**service_label** | A label used as a prefix for naming resources. | Yes | None
**extend_landing_zone_to_new_region** | Whether Landing Zone is being extended to another region. When set to true, compartments, groups, policies and resources at the home region are not provisioned. Use this when you want provision a Landing Zone in a new region, but reuse existing Landing Zone resources in the home region. |  No | false
**use_enclosing_compartment** | A boolean flag indicating whether or not to provision the Landing Zone within an enclosing compartment other than the root compartment. **When provisioning the Landing Zone as a _narrower-permissioned_ user, make sure to set this variable value to true**. | Yes | false
**existing_enclosing_compartment_ocid** | The OCID of a pre-existing enclosing compartment where Landing Zone compartments are to be created. If *use_enclosing_compartment* is false, the module creates the Landing Zone compartments in the root compartment as long as the executing user has the required permissions. | No | None
**policies_in_root_compartment** | The Landing Zone requires policies attached to the root compartment to work at full capacity. For instance, security administrators are expect to manage Cloud Guard, Tag Namespaces, Tag Defaults, Event Rules, and others. Likewise, IAM administrators are expected to manage IAM resources in general. Such capabilities are only enabled if policies are created at the root compartment, as they apply to the tenancy as a whole. A *narrower-permissioned* user will not likely have the permissions to create such policies. As a consequence, it is expected that these policies are previously created by a *wide-permissioned* user. Therefore, **when provisioning the Landing Zone as a _narrower-permissioned_ user, make sure to set this variable value to "USE", in which case permissions are not created at the root compartment**. Default is "CREATE", meaning the module will provision the policies at the root compartment, as long as the executing user has the required permissions. | Yes | "CREATE"
**existing_iam_admin_group_name** | The name of an existing group for IAM administrators. | No | None
**existing_cred_admin_group_name** | The name of an existing group for credential administrators. | No | None
**existing_security_admin_group_name** | The name of an existing group for security administrators. | No | None
**existing_network_admin_group_name** | The name of an existing group for network administrators. | No | None
**existing_appdev_admin_group_name** | The name of an existing group for application development administrators. | No | None
**existing_database_admin_group_name** | The name of an existing group for database administrators. | No | None
**existing_auditor_group_name** | The name of an existing group for auditors. | No | None
**existing_announcement_reader_group_name** | The name of an existing group for announcement readers. | No | None
**existing_cost_admin_group_name** | The name of an existing group for cost management administrators. | No | None
**existing_security_fun_dyn_group_name** | The name of an existing dynamic group to be used by OCI Functions in the Security compartment. | No | None
**existing_appdev_fun_dyn_group_name** | The name of an existing dynamic group to be used by OCI Functions in the AppDev compartment. | No | None
**existing_compute_agent_dyn_group_name** | The name of an existing dynamic group to be used by Compute's management agent in the AppDev compartment. | No | None
**existing_database_kms_dyn_group_name** | The name of an existing dynamic group to be used by databases in the Database compartment to access OCI KMS Keys. | No | None
