# CIS OCI Benchmark to CIS Landing Zone Architecture Mapping
## Overview
The OCI CIS Landing Zone Quick Start Terraform configures services and resources in an OCI tenancy to comply with the [CIS OCI Foundations Benchmark v1.2](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/oracle_cloud/).  This document details how the OCI CIS Landing Zone configuration aligns with the CIS Benchmark v1.2.

## Architecture to CIS OCI Benchmark
The diagram below shows how the services and resources deployed in a single VCN deployment map to the CIS OCI Benchmark v1.2.

## Mapping to CIS OCI Benchmark
The table below documents how the services and resources are configured to meet the CIS OCI Benchmark.

However, this group is not allowed to manage the out-of-box Administrators and Credential Administrators groups. It's also not allowed to touch the out-of-box Tenancy Admin Policy policy. •	Credential Administrators: manage users capabilities and users credentials in general, including API keys, authentication tokens and secret keys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-cis-landingzone-quickstart/blob/main/config/iam_groups.tf Deployment dependent: - https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-cis-landingzone-quickstart/blob/main/config/iam_service_policies.tf   - https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-cis-landingzone-quickstart/blob/main/config/iam_template_policies.tf                                                                                                               |
